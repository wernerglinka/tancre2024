        Ines Tancré was born and raised in Germany.

        She lives and works in Gibsons, BC - Canada.

        After finishing her studies with a PhD in Linguistics and Philosophy she accompanied her husband on his diplomatic postings around the world for many years.

        The constant changes of locations and their particular cultural environments triggered most different, though interrelated themes of her work: the interconnectedness of present and past in the process of perception, the tension between opposites and the enigma resulting from overlays of experiences.

        Ines Tancré has shown her work internationally. As co-founder of the GERMAN AMERICAN ARTISTS she was representing the group in Europe until she came to stay in Canada in 2010.

      prose: |-
        Making different countries home every couple of years shaped my way of perceiving and judging. Together with topical focuses in my studies it lead to questioning so-called reality or “truth” including its visual representation in form of photography. Adding to or eliminating features from the original image creates multilayered meaning and includes the viewer in a process meant to challenge the habitual.

        My work is meant to communicate the link between thinking and feeling, between knowing and guessing, between appearance and the beyond. Some of the images – figurative as well as abstract - are dealing with change and fleetingness, others aim at interpreting a story behind the surface.

        Skin is covering mystery, lines are pointing to the unknown, a moment in time is disintegrating, and opposites are melting together with established views and opinions.
