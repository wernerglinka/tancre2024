        Making different countries home every couple of years shaped my way of perceiving and judging. Together with topical focuses in my studies it lead to questioning so-called reality or “truth” including its visual representation in form of photography. Adding to or eliminating features from the original image creates multilayered meaning and includes the viewer in a process meant to challenge the habitual.

        My work is meant to communicate the link between thinking and feeling, between knowing and guessing, between appearance and the beyond. Some of the images – figurative as well as abstract - are dealing with change and fleetingness, others aim at interpreting a story behind the surface.

        Skin and folds hold mystery. Lines pointing beyond the visual art work, additional colours and markers carry meaning. A moment in time and presumed opposites are disintegrating in a larger context.

        The repetitive filtering process to find ways for minimalist artistic representation on the one hand and throwing a bridge to storytelling on the other represents two sides of my work. It is and has been an ongoing challenge.
